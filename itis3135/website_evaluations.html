    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>

    <section>
      <h3><a href="https://www.costco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Costco</a></h3>
      <p>Costco’s website is designed for straightforward navigation, product discovery, and accessibility. Its layout is clean and purpose-driven, allowing users to find and purchase items efficiently.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Good contrast with readable black text on white backgrounds and bright product images that stand out.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent fonts, buttons, and layout styles throughout the site. Product pages follow uniform templates.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> All elements are well-aligned in grids. Navigation menus, product listings, and banners have strong visual alignment.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related items are grouped logically, making it easy to navigate and understand the content.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
      <p>The Yale School of Art’s website breaks traditional design rules. While it may reflect an experimental aesthetic, its usability suffers due to poor layout and inconsistent styles.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Poor contrast in many areas. Text overlaps images, and some links are difficult to read due to background clashes.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Minimal repetition; fonts, colors, and navigation styles change frequently between pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements appear randomly placed with little regard for visual alignment.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related information is often scattered or loosely grouped, making it difficult to follow.</li>
      </ul>
